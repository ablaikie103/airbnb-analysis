## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using AirBnB data from Boston to better understand:

1. What factors most influence the price of a listing?
2. Can we predict which listings will have a negative review?
3. How much do prices spike in the busiest times of the year?
