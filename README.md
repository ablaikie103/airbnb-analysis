## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using AirBnB data from Boston to better understand:

1. What factors most influence the price of a listing?
2. Can we predict which listings will have a negative review?
3. How much do prices spike in the busiest times of the year?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in the ipython notebooks. 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I used data from Kaggle. You can find the descriptive information at the link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).
